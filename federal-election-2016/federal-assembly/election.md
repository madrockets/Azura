#Federal Assembly Election

As President Rodney Campbell's time at the Presidential Palace comes to an end in time for another election season, Azura is preparing to go to the ballet box to choose the representatives of their state at the Azura Federal Assembly. The current Democratic Party majority in the House is unlikely to continue, as early exit polls are suggesting that it will be a fairly even split between the Socialists and the Democrats, with no other party likely to get a seat.

All major parties in Azura have prepared manifestos, branding and candidate lists in a goal to get a seat in this term's Federal Assembly;

| Party Name  | Ideology | Tagline |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Communists  | Marxism-Leninism, Eurocommunism, internationalism  | Uniting the workers of Azura!  |
| Socialists	| Marxism, trade unionism, progressivism | Leading Azura into the future! |
| Libertarians	| Left-libertarian, syndicalism, enviromentalism | Returning freedoms to all! |
| Liberals	| Internationalism, economic liberalism, non-intervention	| Giving you your own economic freedoms! |
| Greens	| Environmentalism, democratic socialism, progressivism	| Making Azura greater and greener! |
| Democratics | Civic nationalism, social democracy, militarism | Allowing you to have a voice! |
| Nationals | Nationalism, social liberalism, reformism	| Let's put Azura first! |
