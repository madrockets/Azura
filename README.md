# Azura
The Kingdom of Azura is a large, environmentally stunning nation, remarkable for its punitive income tax rates, devotion to social welfare, and stringent health and safety legislation. The democratic population of 12 million love a good election, and the government gives them plenty of them. Universities tend to be full of students debating the merits of various civil and political rights, while businesses are tightly regulated and the wealthy are viewed with suspicion.

The large, socially-minded, outspoken government juggles the competing demands of education, welfare, and healthcare. The average income tax rate is 67.8%, and even higher for the wealthy.

The sizeable Azuran economy, worth 1.41 trillion Azurian Pounds a year, is driven entirely by a combination of government and state-owned industry, with private enterprise illegal. The industrial sector, which is broadly diversified, is led by the creative industry, with major contributions from the arts. The average income is 25,098 Azurian Pounds, and it is distributed extremely evenly, with practically no difference between the richest and poorest citizens.
